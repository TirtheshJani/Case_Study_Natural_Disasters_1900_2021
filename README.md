# A Century of Natural Disasters: Unveiling the Global Impact Trends and Response

## Introduction
"A Century of Natural Disasters" is a comprehensive Tableau project exploring the multifaceted world of natural disasters from 1900 to 2021. The project aims to uncover trends in disaster frequency, severity, and types, while also investigating their human, economic, and geographic consequences. Additionally, it assesses the effectiveness of responses by governments and aid organizations, uncovering opportunities for improved preparedness and resilience against future disasters.

## Project Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of natural disasters over more than a century, including:
- Trends in the frequency and severity of various types of disasters.
- Geographic analysis highlighting regions more prone to specific disasters.
- Evaluation of human, economic impacts.
- Effectiveness of disaster response and aid contributions.
- Opportunities for improved disaster preparedness and response strategies.

## Data Sources
The project utilizes extensive datasets encompassing global natural disaster records from 1900 to 2021. These datasets include information on:
- Types of natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, floods, wildfires).
- Geographical distribution and affected areas.
- Human impact in terms of casualties, injuries, and homelessness.
- Economic repercussions and aid contributions.
